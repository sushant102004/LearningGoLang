Usually program run line by line.

But in concurrent programming we can run code in parallel.

There are two types of concurrent programming: 
1. Threaded Programming
2. Asynchronous Programming

Threaded Programming: In this code run parallely based on number of CPU.

Asynchronous Programming: In this code can pause and resume.
